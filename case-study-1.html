            <p>Originally, I hypothesized a completely different idea for this travel prompt: a mobile app that consolidates every piece of the travel planning process (e.g., transportation, lodging, reservations, etc.). I wanted to think about problems and pain points that I’ve experienced in the past while traveling. Thinking back to my most recent trip to Europe, my biggest frustration was tool/app fragmentation and the lack of integration between them all. 

                I created a proto-persona with a detailed backstory and imagined how she might experience this problem. What are her characteristics? What is her family like? Where does she work? What is important to her? Where does she get frustrated? This helped me filter my ideas through her instead of through my own biases.
                
                To gauge whether my assumption was valid, I conducted 6 user interviews and 6 surveys via Google Forms. These interviews provided me with surprising insights that I hadn’t thought of. After collecting the data and finding common themes through affinity mapping, it became apparent that this hypothesis was too general and had too broad of a scope. While it would have been helpful, the pain point just wasn’t strong enough and the interviewees got by just fine with the way they planned their trip already.</p>

        <dt class="col-sm-3">Reframing The Problem</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">
          <p>One specific insight from an interview caught my attention: the negative impact of travel on climate change. This was an important issue that seemed narrow enough in scope for me to work with. I iterated and pivoted to climate change as my topic.

            After brainstorming what the problem was in the context of climate change and travel planning, I realized there wasn’t an easy way to know what kind of impact a person’s travel was having on our planet. I iterated on my persona and created an empathy map to gain more understanding and align her ideals with this new topic. For the sake of time, I kept the scope small and focused on commercial flights. What if there was a way to minimize and bring awareness to the harmful impact aviation has on climate change? I conducted a competitor and SWOT analysis to see what was already out there and see if this was even possible. While I did find similar ideas with some nice features (e.g., offsetting carbon emissions with purchases of a given product or service), the execution was poor. They were either too vague or too complicated and didn’t make clear what kind of impact these transactions were having on carbon emissions. I wanted to get deeper and find a way my persona’s actions could be measured against climate change and carbon emissions.

        <dt class="col-sm-3">Set It In Stonea</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">
            <p>I needed to define my problem statement and user insight to understand the motive of my persona. Instead of climate change being this broad topic that was difficult for an individual to grasp on a personal level, I wanted my persona to be confident that her actions as an individual were making some kind of difference. She’s aware of the harmful impact flying has on the environment but needs to fly for her job. Because of this, she feels guilt and is internally conflicted. If she knew that she could at least lessen the impact, this would resolve those negative emotions and even motivate her to share with others.
            </p>
        </dd>
      
        <dt class="col-sm-3 text-truncate">Blue-Sky Ideation</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">
            <p>How could this be achieved? I ideated with exercises like “I Like, I Wish, What If?”. What if each flight my persona booked had a calculated carbon footprint score that could be compared with similar flights? Would this change the way she travelled? What if she were incentivized to book the least harmful flight to a given destination and share across social media? What if this process was gamified (e.g., streaks or competition with other users of the app) to motivate and inspire my persona? Again, to keep the scope from becoming to broad, I narrowed down my features using a feature prioritization matrix and formed a value proposition that could simply explain the mobile app on a higher level: “Save the planet on your next trip”.

                How would this app be used by my persona? What real life situation would she be in to prompt her to use the app? To make this come to life, I created a user scenario, a storyboard, and a user journey map. With a real world narrative and motive, this helped to reinforce the overarching idea.
                
                I called the app Footprint. Each flight would display a “footprint” score based on an accurate carbon footprint equation and the user would be rewarded for choosing a flight with the lowest score. These rewards could be something like a coupon from a sponsored sustainable clothing company or tree planted on the user’s behalf. They would be incentivized to share their impact to help bring awareness and attract more users. As they continue booking flights, the app could generate statistics that displayed how much their conscious travelling impacting the planet (e.g., number of trees saved). Other ideas included providing resources and educational facts about climate change.</p>

            <dd class="col-sm-8">
                <p>With a firm understanding and solid plan in place, I began prototyping. First off, I needed to understand what the critical path would be for my persona. When she opened the app for the first time, what would she need? Where would she go? I created a user flow to define every step she would take in the app. Based on her needs and the real-life scenario she was in, she would search for flights, compare them based on the “footprint” score, book the flight with the lowest score, and create an account to track her booking history for future use.

                    Now I could begin the visualization of everything I’ve done up to this point. I started by creating a moodboard for inspiration and began lo-fi sketches to quickly get the ideas out of my head on paper. Using Figma, I worked on and iterated mid-fi wireframes to ensure that the critical path was functional, clickable, and easy to navigate. I wanted to ensure that there were no blindspots in the design. While I personally thought it was easy to navigate, I needed usability testing with users that had an objective point of view and provided honest feedback. I conducted 5 usability tests and received some critical feedback that improved the user experience overall. Finally, I went back to the drawing board and iterated.

                  <p>Being the first project in class, I gained a massive amount of understanding and learned some valuable lessons:</p>
                <ul class="list-styled">
                    <li>Design with empathy. Feel what your user or persona feels.</li>
                    <li>Design is not a linear process and can take you to some unexpected places if you let it. Let the user research data guide you.</li>
                    <li>Iterate, iterate, iterate.</li>
                    <li>The user research phase is vital to great design. If you don’t know who you’re designing for, you’ll miss the mark no matter how shiny the final deliverable is. </li>
                    <li>Don’t fall in love or be stubborn with your ideas or designs. Be flexible, open-minded, and humble.</li>
                    <li>Having a realistic persona helps keep the focus on your users and their needs.</li>
                    <li>Be aware of your biases and always assume that you will have blindspots.</li>
                    <li>Get your ideas out of your head and on paper as quickly as possible. Don’t leave any idea off the table.</li>
                    <li>Conduct more interviews in the research phase and more usability tests in the prototyping phase. Iterate as much as possible to improve usability.</li>
                    <li>For this project specifically:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create a second persona that isn’t as educated or aware of climate change. They could potentially have a different critical path and user experience. Instead of feeling guilt like my original persona, they may be completely illuminated by this new perspective of travel.
                            </li>
                            <li>With more time, I would expand the form of travel to auto, train, boat, etc.</li>
