        This was a group project assigned in the UX/UI Bootcamp through UC Berkeley Extension. There was no prompt for this assignment. Rather, the goal was to work through the entire design process with the focus on collaboration. 
        <br><br>
        Our group of 5 people set out to discover what topic we wanted to focus on for this project. After a collaborative brainstorming session, we settled on this problem statement:
    </p>
    <br>
    <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
        <p class="mb-0">A growing number of young adults are frustrated, lost, and anxious due to feeling like they aren’t good enough and have no one to help them achieve standards of what society deems successful.
        
            Providing accessible guidance and mentorship for adults in transition will equip them with the crucial support that they need to succeed and thrive as adults.</p>

        <dd class="col-sm-9">
            <p>During the user research phase, we interviewed a total of five people with the age range of 22-35. The most striking insight was that no one felt that they were “adults” yet, and felt the need for someone to help them in various aspects of everyday life - professional growth, emotional well-being, education, etc. Prior to the interviews, our group hypothesized that financial advice would be a priority but we were surprised to find that 4 out of 5 users interviewed did not mention this.
            <br><br>
            For this project, we decided to prioritize an empathy map rather than a specific user persona. The scope was larger and we agreed that an empathy map would provide a broader set of user emotions, thoughts, and actions.
            <br><br>
            After condensing the data from the five interviews, we sorted them out in terms of common categories to create an affinity map. After sorting, we voted on the insights we thought were most valuable to our app.
